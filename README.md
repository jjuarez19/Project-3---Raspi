# Project-3---Raspi
Doge Meme Reference Template: https://www.kapwing.com/studio/editor (This actually an editor for the classic Doge picture if you'd like to conjure up custom Doge memes)
Api: https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random

This project is setup as a "Doge" meme generator, that uses Api calls to print pictures from the random dog Api database onto an HTML page. The webpage is being run on a Flask server that once booted up will start to print pictures of random dogs in the center of the page every 5 seconds. In testing, the time intervals in which the pictures print can be set higher or lower, I even went as low as 50 milliseconds. The server itself is being run on a Raspberry Pi 4.
